# Statistical Learning with Python: Chapter Notes and Exercises

This repository contains my personal notes and completed exercises as I work through the excellent textbook, *An Introduction to Statistical Learning: with Applications in Python*. The main purpose of this repository is to document my work and solidify my understanding of the concepts presented in each chapter.

## Repository Contents

The repository is organized by chapter. Each Jupyter Notebook corresponds to a specific chapter from the textbook, containing code examples, key takeaways, and solutions to the exercises.

The naming convention is `chapter_[number].ipynb`, where `[number]` represents the chapter number.

- `chapter_3.ipynb`: Notes and exercises for Chapter 3 (Linear Regression).
- `chapter_4.ipynb`: Notes and exercises for Chapter 4 (Classification).
- *(and so on...)*

## Usage

To run these notebooks, you will need a Python environment with Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab installed. The project uses common data science libraries such as `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `scikit-learn`.

For a precise list of dependencies for any given chapter, **please refer to the import statements in the first cell of the corresponding notebook.**
